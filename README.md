# Ensemble

Even with the popularity that music streaming services have seen over the last decade, there are still many people who either download or rip audio files. Most of these music collections are unorganized and difficult to navigate. Moreover, managing large numbers of files becomes cumbersome and inefficient. Due to this, we propose *Ensemble*, a desktop application with the capabilities of both an **offline music player** and a **music library manager**.
